## 🔄 Project Workflow

This project follows a **3‑phase data pipeline**:

### ✅ 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Raw dataset: `customer_shopping_behavior.csv` (3,900 rows)

Key transformations performed:

* 🧹 **Missing Value Imputation**

  * 37 missing `review_rating` values filled using **median rating per product category**
* 🏷️ **Column Standardization**

  * Converted headers to `snake_case` for SQL compatibility
* 🧠 **Feature Engineering**

  * `age_group` via statistical quartiles → Young Adult / Adult / Middle‑aged / Senior
  * `purchase_frequency_days` converted into numeric values (e.g., Weekly → 7)
* 🚫 **Redundant Column Removal**

  * Dropped duplicate column `promo_code_used`

➡️ Final cleaned dataset loaded into PostgreSQL table: **`customer`**
